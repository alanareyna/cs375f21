Exercise 8
Name: Alana Reyna

Part 1
2. After reviewing the contents of the file Ex1.cpp, compile Ex1.cpp (using g++) and execute
the program. Were the results what you expected?
    Yes, this is exactly what I expected the program to do. Reading line by line, it's clear 
    what is going on. 

3. Try to compile the class Ex1 in Ex1.java. Why is there a syntax error?
    The reason is the program is missing a closing bracket to close out class Ex1
    on line 32.

5. Now try to compile the program. What semantic error message is generated? Why?
    error: ';' expected. The reason for this is that there are () after the object initialization. 
    This is not the proper way to initialize java objects. 

7. Compile Ex1.java and execute Ex1. Were the results what you expected?
    results:
    obj1 = Integer: 0; Double: 0.0
    obj2 = Integer: 5; Double: 7.7
    obj1 = Integer: 10; Double: 7.7
    obj2 = Integer: 10; Double: 7.7

    I expected the last print statement outting obj2 to be Integer: 5; Double: 7.7

9. Compile Ex1.java and execute Ex1. Were the results what you expected?
    results:
    obj1 = Integer: 0; Double: 0.0
    obj2 = Integer: 5; Double: 7.7
    obj1 = Integer: 10; Double: 7.7
    obj2 = Integer: 5; Double: 7.7

    I had a hunch that this would happen. Since we are just making a copy, I expected that 
    any changes to obj1 would not affect obj2. 

10. Were the results (look above the error message) what you expected? Why did
the program produce a “double free or corruption” error?
    results:
    obj1 = Size: 0; Doubles:
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 7.7 8.47 9.317 10.2487 11.2736
    obj1 = Size: 5; Doubles: 15.4 16.94 18.634 20.4974 22.5471
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 15.4 16.94 18.634 20.4974 22.5471
    free(): double free detected in tcache 2
    Aborted (core dumped)

    Yes, this result is what I expected. The program responds similarly to #7. Since
    obj1 gets set equal to obj2, any changes to one will roll over to the other object. 

12. Compile Ex2.cpp and execute the program. Are the results now what you expected when you
first read the program?
    results:
    obj1 = Size: 0; Doubles:
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 7.7 8.47 9.317 10.2487 11.2736
    obj1 = Size: 5; Doubles: 15.4 16.94 18.634 20.4974 22.5471
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 7.7 8.47 9.317 10.2487 11.2736

    Yes, this is what I expected. Now that we have the assignment operator, this prevents us 
    from making changes to obj2 when changes are made to obj1 since the assignment operator
    creates a deep copy of obj1 and sets it to obj2. Since changes are made to obj1 after the 
    assignment operator is called, it will not carry over the changes to obj2. 

13. After reviewing the contents of the file Ex2.java, compile Ex2.java and execute Ex2. Were
the results what you expected?
    results:
    obj1 = Size: 0; Doubles:
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 7.7 8.47 9.317000000000002 10.248700000000003 11.273570000000005
    obj1 = Size: 5; Doubles: 15.4 16.94 18.634000000000004 20.497400000000006 22.54714000000001
    obj2 = Size: 5; Doubles: 7.7 8.47 9.317000000000002 10.248700000000003 11.273570000000005   

    Yes, this is what I expected. Since how we saw in #9, when we make a copy, changes made to 
    the one object will not affect the other.

15. Compile Ex2.java and execute Ex2. Are the results now what you expected when you first
read the program?
    results:
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot load from double array because "<local1>.doublevalues" is null
        at Ex2.main(Ex2.java:50)
    
    I expected there to be an error but I wasn't sure what the particular error would do. We are 
    trying to access data that doesn't exist in the class variable doublevalues but rather the local
    variable that was declared in copy. Therefore, trying to access data from the associated array
    will fail.
