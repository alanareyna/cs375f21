Exercise 7 Questions

Name: Alana Reyna

3. *What are the transformations applied to the red polygons?
translate (50 20) scale (2.0)
scale (2.0) translate (50 20)

4. *What are the transformations applied to the green polygons?
translate (50 20) rotate (20)
rotate (20) translate (50 20)

5. *What are the transformations applied to the purple polygons?
scale (2.0) rotate (20)
rotate (20) scale (2.0)

6. *Why are there 2 red polygons and 2 green polygons, but only 1 purple polygon?
The reason that there is only one purple polygon is that the two purple polygons are 
overriding each other. When calculating the points using scale and rotate in both orders,
I came to the same results for each of the points. However, with the other polygons, switching
the order of the transformations does change the resulting points of the polygons. 

8. *What transformations are applied to the red polygon?
rotate (20) scale (2.0) translate (50 20)

9. *What transformations are applied to the orange polygon?
rotate (20) translate (50 20) scale (2.0)

10. *What transformations are applied to the yellow polygon?
scale (2.0) rotate (20) translate (50 20)

11. *What transformations are applied to the green polygon?
scale (2.0) translate (50 20) rotate (20)

12. *What transformations are applied to the blue polygon?
translate (50 20) rotate (20) scale (2.0)

13. *What transformations are applied to the purple polygon?
translate (50 20) scale (2.0) rotate (20)

14. *Why are the red and blue polygons not visible in the image?
The reason the blue polygon is not visible is because it gets overridden by the 
purple polygon. This means their points are the same after the transformations are applied. 
The reason the red polygon is not visible is because it gets overridden by the 
yellow polygon. The reason the order did not change the results of the red vs yellow polygon and the 
blue vs purple polygon is because rotate and scale can be in any order and you will get the same
result. Since translate is done before the rotate and scale transformations for blue and purple, it does
not affect the result of the points. This is the same for red and yellow polygons. 

15. *The same transformations have been applied to the same polygon to create the 
    red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple polygons. Why are most of them in different locations?*
The reason they are in different locations is because of the order translate is in. Changing where we call translate
will change the result of the points. Scale and rotate can be interchanged without resulting in different points 
and locations.
