Part 4 - 10. Is it possible to create a perfect circle using one or more quadratic or cubic curves?
No, you could get a close approximation but not optain a perfect circle. There is not an exact  

Part 5 - 5. The same transformations have been applied to all 3 of the new rectangles. Why are they in different locations in the image?
Although the transformations have been applied to all 3 of the new rectangles, they are ordered differently which is why they are in 
different locations of the image. For example, the second rectangle, all the points are adjusted by scaling them by 1.5. This means the x and y values
are multiplied by 1.5. Then the points are adjusted with rotate by applying the rotation matrix convention. Then, these new x and y values are again adjusted 
by applying the translate transformation. When these operations take place in a different order, the resulting points will be different since we get different 
x and y values by the different transformations. These operations take place linearly, they are not all applied in the same order, therefore, all of the 
rectangles will have different locations because the transformations take place in a different order for each of them.
